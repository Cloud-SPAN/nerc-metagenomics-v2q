## Overview

This lesson shows how to automate the analyses run in the previous lessons except the R tasks in the last lesson.  

To consider:

- Running commands on multiple files rather than a single file --- after the base script. 
  - using directory names instead of file names 
- Do we need scripts in the local machine too?

Next sections contain the code in each lesson episode to be considered to automate it.
